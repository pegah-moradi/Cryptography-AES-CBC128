We are provided with:
1. A plaintext
2. A ciphertext
3. A file containing all possible secret keys.
Our purpose is to determine the key used for encryption. We should utilize AES-128-CBC as the cryptography algorithm. 
To address this challenge, a Java code has been developed, employing a brute-force approach to identify the correct key.
